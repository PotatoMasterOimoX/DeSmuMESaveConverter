# DeSmuMESaveConverter

DeSmuMESaveConverter is a simple python script that converts between DeSmuME save files (`.dsv`) to raw DS save files (`.sav`), mainly used in the homebrew DS scene.

## Usage

Any files put inside the `in/` folder will be converted to the other file type (e.g. `.dsv` will convert to `.sav`, and `.sav` will convert to `.dsv`). Output files will be dropped in the `out/` folder.

To convert files in the `in/` folder, run `main.py`.

## Contributing
